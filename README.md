# How It's Made:
Tech Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript
The Black vs. Blue etch a sketch is a game built with basic HTML/CSS/Javascript. The goal of this project was to make a playable etch-a-sketch that allows the user to chose their own paintbrush size and switch between colours. The grid is built through DOM manipulation instead of being hardcoded into the project. 

# Optimizations:
Next phase is to include more colour variation and the ability to print and download your art.

# Lessons Learned:
You don't always have to use as many libraries and different technologies as possible to build something fun. I really enjoyed building out this app and the goal was to keep it as simple as possible. This project has got me amped up for future projects that are as fun to build as they are to test!
